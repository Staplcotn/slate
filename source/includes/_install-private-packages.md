# Install Private Packages

First off, create a personal access token.

```shell
# This is an extremely important and time-saving step!
# Add to your .bashrc (or to Windows Env variables)
export NPM_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"


# This should be in your global & per-project .npmrc file
@scca:registry=https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/packages/npm
//gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
//gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/projects/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

### Personal Access Tokens

Create a **Personal Access Token** under your [Profile Settings](https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) with _at least_ the `read_api` scope.

Then, add this Personal Access Token to your Environment Variables.

Create a `.npmrc` file in the project that needs a private package and put the snippet to the right in it.

## Private Packages in Containers

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
ARG NPM_TOKEN
COPY .npmrc .npmrc
COPY package.json package.json
RUN npm install
RUN rm -f .npmrc
```

```shell
# Pass ARGs with build-args
docker build --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=${NPM_TOKEN} .

```

As per [npm's official documentation here](https://docs.npmjs.com/docker-and-private-modules#create-and-check-in-a-project-specific-npmrc-file), to install private packages during your container's build step, copy a `.npmrc` file into your container so that Yarn or NPM knows where to get your private packages.

We then delete that `.npmrc` file to prevent it from being in the final image, for security reasons.

We then pass the _actual_ token as a `build-arg` that corresponds to the `ARG` in your `Dockerfile`. This concept also applies when building your image with Kaniko.

## Publishing Private Packages

After setting up your package to automatically version itself, you can configure it to automatically publish itself as an NPM package.

You can still manually publish your package, but you have to manually change the `version` property in your `package.json` for NPM to publish a new version to Gitlab.

Each project on Gitlab has it's own [Package Registry](https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/scca/stapl-api/-/packages), (not to be confused with [Container Registries](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/index.html)). We tried putting all packages into a single project, but you end up with _each version_ of _each package_ all in one place, and it's just a mess.

```yaml
# Gitlab Runner job
bumpver:
  stage: bumpver
  before_script:
    - touch .npmrc
    - echo "@scca:registry=https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/packages/npm/" >> .npmrc
    - echo "//gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=\"$CI_JOB_TOKEN\"" >> .npmrc
    - echo "//gitlab.staplcotn.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/packages/npm/:_authToken=\"$CI_JOB_TOKEN\"" >> .npmrc
    - yarn install --silent
    - yarn run build
  only:
    refs:
      - master
```

### Publishing with Gitlab Runner

The [Gitlab Package Registry](https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/scca/stapl-api/-/packages) documentation does a good job of giving examples and instructions.

To the right is an example of a working Gitlab Runner job that should be used **in conjuction** with the Semantic Release template from above. This runs _before_ Semantic Release, creating **publishable assets**, because Semantic Release itself cannot do a _build-step_ â€“ you must create assets _for_ Semantic Release to publish.

To explain the flow a little better (and because I always forget):

<div class="mermaid" style="margin-left: 0;">
%%{init: {'theme':'base'}}%%
     graph TD

      A[fa:fa-gitlab CI Job Starts]
      A-->|Starts bumpver job|B(before_script section of your custom job begins)
      B-->End>fa:fa-check Assets and .npmrc are available for Semantic Release to use]
      style End fill:#3DCC91;

</div>
