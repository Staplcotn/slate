# Getting Started

## An Example App

[Here is an example app](https://gitlab.staplcotn.com/scca/app-boilerplate) that has a `Dockerfile` and `gitlab-ci.yml` file. It's all you need to get started with containerizing apps. Just read the README there.

## What all do I need?

Nothing if you start with the example app above.

**If all you want to do is containerize your app and run it on our cluster**, you don't need any CLIs, so you can skip to [Resource Files.](#resource-files)

## Installing Kubectl

<small>assuming you need kubectl...</small><br/>
`Kubectl` is the CLI for working with Kubernetes clusters. **If you don't need to directly work with a cluster, you do not need this right now**, but the link is here for when you do.
